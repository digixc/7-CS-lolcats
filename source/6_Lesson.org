- To earn your last badge, you need to customise your pet.
- The time you have to do this will depend on how quickly you finished the other lessons.
- *Customise your script* to make it your own project. You can add anything that you like, but some ideas might be to:
  - *PetFitness* - If your Pet doesn't exercise it can grow fatter, maybe it performs a little animation when you tell it to exercise.
  - *PetToilet* - Maybe your pet becomes stinky if it doesn't go to the toilet.
  - *PetCleaniness* - Make your pet take a shower or bath when he becomes dirty.
  - *Pet Behaviour* - Maybe your pet runs about the screen, or starts messing with other sprites and you have to punish your pet to make it behave.
  - *Music* - Add a BoomBox that when it plays music your pet starts to dance.
  - *Background* - Change the background, add items of scenary or other sprites that can interact with your pet.
- The quality and complexity of your customisation will determine which colour badge your teacher awards you.
- Here are some sprites that you could use:
