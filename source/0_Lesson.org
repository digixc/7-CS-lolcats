*Programming & Development*

 - Students will understand that programs run by following a sequence of instructions.
 - Students will make use of: arithmetic operators, if statements, and loops within their programs.
 - Students will be able to declare and assign variables and lists.
 - Students will develop understanding of structured programming using functions.
 
 *Algorithms*

 - Students will understand what an algorithm is.
 - Students will understand that iteration is the repetition of a process such as a loop.
 - Students will understand that selection is used to change the outcome of a program based on conditions.
 - Students will design and implement simple algorithms using iteration (loops), and selection (if, then and else).
 
*Literacy*

- Students will use correct grammar, punctuation and spelling of keywords throughout this project.

*Information Technology*
 - Students will create, store and edit digital content using appropriate file and folder names.
 - Students will talk about their work and make improvements to solutions based on feedback received (BTL).
 - Students will use a variety of software to manipulate and present digital content. (Scratch, Snipping tool, Paint, Word & BTC)
 - Students will show an awareness for the quality of digital content collected. (Images used in Scratch as sprites or backgrounds)
