Scratch is a programming language that can be used to make small programs and games. Above is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Scratch. A GUI is how the a user interacts with software.
** Learn It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- The Scratch GUI is split into 4 sections
- These are listed below
[[file:img/KEY.png]]
- The key areas are:
 1. The Blocks Palette
 2. The Scripts Area
 3. The Stage
 4. The Sprite List
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
If you've used Scratch before and already have an account, then you can skip this section.
- Goto [[http://scratch.mit.edu][THIS LINK to the Scratch website]]
- Click on the *Join Scratch button* in the menu bar.
[[file:img/join.png]]
[[file:img/SignUp.png]]
- Fill in the details required. Be sure to pick a *username* and *password* /you will remember/.
- You may need to use your *personal email address* when you register.
- Once you are logged in, click on the *Create button* in the menu bar.
[[file:img/create.png]]
- Now we can name our file. Call it *Practice Scripts.*
[[file:img/title.png]]
- *Scratch works* by *dragging blocks of code* from the *blocks palate* into the *script area*. These *blocks* then can be *stacked* to *create scripts.*
- Let's make a simple Script. From the Blocks Palate, choose *Events.*
[[file:img/Scripts_menu.png]]
- Now, *click and drag* the *following block* on to the *Scripts Area.*
[[file:img/Green_flag.png]]
- Next choose the *Looks* scripts from the menu.
- Click and drag the /say Hello! for 2 secs/ block and snap it to the *When flag clicked* block.
[[file:img/Hello.png]] 
** Run It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: run
:END:
- *To run our Scratch script*, you just need to click on the *Green Flag* in the Stage area.
[[file:img/Hello2.png]]

** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Now let's try something a little more complicated.
- *Delete your current script* by *dragging* it *back* to the *Blocks Pallette.*
- We're going to make the cat grow. You'll need to search through the Blocks Pallette to find the appropriate blocks, and build the script as it's shown below.
- Now click on the *Green Flag* in the Stage area to run your code.

*** Learning strand: Programming and Development and algorithms

** Badge It: Cat Talk
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: silver
:END:
*** Silver - Cat Talk
- After you have completed the code in Scratch as shown above, try changing what the cat says and how long it says it for.
- Follow the video tutorial on how to upload your work and upload your work to www.bournetolearn.com.

** Badge It: Cat Shrink!
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: gold
:END:
*** Gold - Cat Shrinking
- Try to change the script so that after the cat has grown, it says "I'm Shrinking!" and then returns to it's regular size.
- /HINT:/ You can use negative numbers in Scratch

** Badge It: Cat Circles
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: platinum
:END:
*** Platinum - Cat moving in circles
- To get your platinum badge, you need to *make the cat move* around in a *large circle.*
- You'll probably want to look into using a loop to achieve this.
